- 👋 Hi, I’m @b33fl0w
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to program any way I can!
- 🌱 I’m currently at the very beginning of my journey. Starting with the Harvard CS50 course!
- 💞️ The idea of collaboration at this point is terrifying. But if someone wants to mentor me I won't complain 😅
- 📫 Reach me here!
